# About
This is an extract from  the educative.io course on spring. The course is available for free with the github student pack.

**You will find the course in pdf and the code concerning all JPA relationships cases.**

You can run some tests using the thunder extension in VScode or Postman. Just import this file [thunder-collection_SpringEducativeSchool.json](./Code/thunder-collection_SpringEducativeSchool.json)

I added some code exemple for the composite key which wasn't covered in the course. I suggest you use the [8_SpringDataCompositeKey](./Code/8_SpringDataCompositeKey) which worked fined for me unlike the exemple [7_CompositeKey_ManyToMany](./Code/7_CompositeKey_ManyToMany) from baeldung.

the [MyNotes.md](./Code/MyNotes.md) file is just a resume from the course, it's of no interest...

If you want to add a relationship (is there any other ?!) or participate please do !
